			<p class="flavor">Unleash Chaotic Magic</p>
			<p>Your innate magic stems from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. You or an ancestor might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo or the Elemental Planes. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke with no apparent cause. Whatever its source, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.</p>

			<p>Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, you can roll 1d20 immediately after you cast a Sorcerer spell with a spell slot. If you roll a 20, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the magical effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic.</p>

				<tr><td>01-04</td><td>Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>05-08</td><td>A creature that is Friendly toward you appears in a random unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. The creature is under the DM’s control and disappears 1 minute later. Roll 1d4 to determine the creature: on a 1, a Modron Duodrone appears; on a 2, a Flumph appears; on a 3, a Modron Monodrone appears; on a 4, a Unicorn appears. See the Monster Manual for the creature’s stat block.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>09-12</td><td>For the next minute, you regain 5 Hit Points at the start of each of your turns.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>13-16</td><td>Creatures have Disadvantage on saving throws against the next spell you cast in the next minute that involves a saving throw.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>17-20</td><td>You are subjected to an effect that lasts for 1 minute unless its description says otherwise. Roll 1d8 to determine the effect: on a 1, you’re surrounded by faint, ethereal music only you and creatures within 5 feet of you can hear; on a 2, your size increases by one size category; on a 3, you grow a long beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode from your face and vanish; on a 4, you must shout when you speak; on a 5, illusory butterflies flutter in the air within 10 feet of you; on a 6, an eye appears on your forehead, granting you Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks; on an 7, pink bubbles float out of your mouth whenever you speak; on an 8, your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue for 24 hours or until the effect is ended by a Remove Curse spell.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>21-24</td><td>For the next minute, all your spells with a casting time of an action have a casting time of a Bonus Action.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>25-28</td><td>You are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of your next turn. You then return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>29-32</td><td>The next time you cast a spell that deals damage within the next minute, don’t roll the spell’s damage dice for the damage. Instead use the highest number possible for each damage die.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>33-36</td><td>You have Resistance to all damage for the next minute.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>37-40</td><td>You turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. While you’re a plant, you have the Incapacitated condition and have Vulnerability to all damage. If you drop to 0 Hit Points, your pot breaks, and your form reverts.</td></tr>

				<tr><td>53-56</td><td>You can take one extra action on this turn.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>57-60</td><td>You cast a random spell. If the spell normally requires Concentration, it doesn’t require Concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.
