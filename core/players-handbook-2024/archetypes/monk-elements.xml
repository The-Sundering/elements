			<p>At the start of your turn, you can expend 1 Focus Point to imbue yourself with elemental energy. The energy lasts for 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition. You gain the following benefits while this feature is active.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>Reach.</strong></em> When you make an Unarmed Strike, your reach is 10 feet greater than normal, as elemental energy extends from you.</p>
			<p class="indent"><em><strong>Elemental Strikes.</strong></em> Whenever you hit with your Unarmed Strike, you can cause it to deal your choice of Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage rather than its normal damage type. When you deal one of these types with it, you can also force the target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you can move the target up to 10 feet toward or away from you, as elemental energy swirls around it.</p>
